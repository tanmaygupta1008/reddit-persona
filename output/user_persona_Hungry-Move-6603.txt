Summary:
- Scam.]
- Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand.]
- I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.  He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.]
- Cops keep a civ around to discuss bribes.]
- Toh hum Noida or Ghaziabad se pahadio ko bhagana shuru karein fir? ðŸ˜‚ Bhukmari ajaegi]
